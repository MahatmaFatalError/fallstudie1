%Überleitung zu den Lösungsansätzen
The purpose of this paper is to make a recommendation for a new restaurant business in Germany. Especially to find a good city for opening a restaurant based on different facts as well as reaching the mentioned financial specifications of the investment.
A good indicator to discover a new restaurant business is to analyze restaurants which already exist. In the meantime the world wide web and it's community platforms are inevitable. Customers can leave reviews and rate their restaurant visits online. One of this platforms with its thousands of restaurants and other business cases is definitely Yelp Inc\footnote{\href{https://www.yelp.com/}{www.yelp.com}}. Yelp offers an \ac{API} for developers which can be accessed to collect the restaurant data, e.g. the name, rating, city etc. For a significant analysis more information is needed. As a consequence we collect more relevant key figures which help to find an appropriate city. This includes a dataset of all cities in Germany and its population as well as data about the buying power and the rent average for industrial buildings. The main idea is to combine all the mentioned key figures to calculate a \ac{KPI} to find the most appropriate cities in Germany for starting a restaurant business. Furthermore we analyze the user's text reviews on Yelp to get more insights about the existing restaurants and their favorite dishes of different food categories. As to that the restaurant menu's of an example city are analyzed to discover the most popular items. We develop python scripts to collect and store all the data in the Google Cloud Platform, more precisely in its Datastore which is a \ac{NoSQL} document database. From there it was possible to create a \pg{}‚ instance with the fully-managed relational database service, the so called Google Cloud SQL. For a significant analysis of the raw datasets it was necessary to clean it thoroughly. For this part we developed python scripts as well as different database queries. \newline For the financial part we used a benchmark of Germany's catering industry which includes lots of different key figures like the number of guests per day or the average consumption per guest as well as the revenues and expenses in detail in order to act as economically as possible.
