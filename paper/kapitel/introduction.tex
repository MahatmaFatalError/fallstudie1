%Überleitung zu den Lösungsansätzen
The purpose of the thesis is to make a recommendation for a new restaurant business in Germany. Especially to find a good location for opening a restaurant based on different facts as well as reaching the mentioned financial specifications of the investment.
A good indicator to discover a new restaurant business is to analyse restaurants that are already running. By that time the world wide web and it's community platforms are inevitable. Customers can leave reviews and rate the restaurant visits online. One of the most popular community platforms is yelp with it's thousands of restaurants and other businesses which can be accessed. Yelp offers an API for developers which was connected with python scripts to collect the restaurant data, e.g. name, rating, location and so on. There were some other important key figures that help to find an appropiate location, especially the dataset with all of Germany's cities and its population as well as the datasets including the buying power and the rent average for industrial buildings. All the collected data were stored in the Google Cloud Platform with the help of python scripts, more precisely in it's Datastore which is a NoSQL document database. From there it was possible to create a postgreSQL istance with the fully-managed relational database service, the so called Google Cloud SQL. For a significant analysis of the raw datasets it was necessary to clean it thoroughly. This was made with the help of python scripts and different datebase queries. The idea was to fit a statistical model for the mentioned key figures to find out the best cities for starting a restaurant business in Germany. In addition to that we implemented a sentiment analysis to categorize each of the users reviews on yelp into positiv or negative sentiment due to the words that were used in the text. Also the menus for restaurants in the case of Mannheim were analyzed to get more insights about the existing restaurants like the favorite items of different restarant categories. For the financial aspects it was used a benchmark of Germany's catering industry which included lots of different key figures like the number of guests per day or the average consumption per guest as well as the revenues and expenses in detail.
