\subsection{Monetary Analysis}
\label{subsec:moneten}
The target, mentioned in \fullref{subsec:usecase}, is to generate a turnover of 40000 euros per month. The available Budget
 is 750000 euros high. In order to generate this turnover a calculation with various parameters such as seat turnover,
 opening days, consumption and area of the guest section are required. To analyze the minimum number of seats for the
 restaurant is calculated as follows:
\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	min.number_{seats} = \frac{turnover.restaurant_{month}}{turnover.seat_{day} \times average.consumption_{guest} \times opening_{days}} \\
	= \frac{40000 euros}{1.5 \times 20 euros \times 26} \\
	= 51.28
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:number_seats_benchmark}
\end{equation}
\end{center}

With having the rounded minimum number of seats the calculation of the total floor space is the next step. This parameter is
 necessary for a specific query of the ImmobilienScout24 Search API \cite{ImmoScout} as well as the number of seats,
 which can be applied as range of values. The lower threshold is 52 seats and the upper threshold is 65 seats. The upper
 threshold is an increase of 25 percent. This interval can be used to calculate the required total floor area using the
 following formula:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	total.floor.area_{min} = floorspace_{guest} \times seats_{min} \times \frac{100}{40} \\
	total.floor.area_{max} = floorspace_{guest} \times seats_{max} \times \frac{100}{40} \\
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:total_floor_space}
\end{equation}

where $floorspace_{guest}$ is the average floor space for a System-Service-Restaurant per guest \cite{FlaecheGast} and the
 percentage of the guest area is 40 percent mentioned in \cite{FlaecheGastronomie}.
