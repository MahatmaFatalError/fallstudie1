\subsection{Investment Analysis}
\label{subsec:moneten}
The target, mentioned in \fullref{subsec:usecase}, is to generate a turnover of 40000 euros per month. The available Budget
 is 750000 euros high. In order to generate this turnover a calculation with various parameters such as seat turnover,
 opening days, consumption and area of the guest section are required. To calculate the minimum number of seats for the
 restaurant the following formula is used:
\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	min.number_{seats} = \frac{turnover.restaurant_{month}}{turnover.seat_{day} \times average.consumption_{guest} \times opening_{days}} \\
	= \frac{40000 euros}{1.5 \times 20 euros \times 26} \\
	= 51.28
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:number_seats_benchmark}
\end{equation}
\end{center}

With having the rounded minimum number of seats the computation of the total floor space is next. The total
 floor space parameter is necessary for the specific query of the ImmobilienScout24 Search API \cite{ImmoScout} and as
 well as the number of seats, which can be applied as range of values. The lower threshold is 52 seats and the upper
 threshold is 65 seats. The upper threshold is an increase of 25 percent. This interval can be used to calculate the
 required total floor area using the following formula:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	total.floor.area_{min} = floorspace_{guest} \times seats_{min} \times \frac{100}{40} \\
	total.floor.area_{max} = floorspace_{guest} \times seats_{max} \times \frac{100}{40} \\
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:total_floor_space}
\end{equation}

where $floorspace_{guest}$ is the average floor space for a System-Service-Restaurant per guest \cite{FlaecheGast} and the
 amount of the guest area is 40 percent mentioned in \cite{FlaecheGastronomie}.

In order to apply the financing analysis, the Geo-ID of the top 10 cities is queried using the \textit{GeoAutoCompletion (GAC)
 v2 \ac{API}} of ImmobilienScout24. With this specific ID the real estate object can be queried via the Search \ac{API}
 with the defined parameters of the Region Search Query. The used available Parameters are $min.number_{seats}$, $total.floor.area_{min}$,
 $total.floor.area_{max}$, the realestate specific parameter \textit{gastronomy} and gastronomytype \textit{restaurant}.
