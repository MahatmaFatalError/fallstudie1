\subsection{Inductive Analysis}
\label{subsec:analysis}


\paragraph{Setup \& Assumptions}
Starting with the technical setup, it should be mentioned that the following analyses were calculated with the R programming language. Each approach follows the same procedure: Preparation and loading of the to be analyzed data via SQL, application of the appropriate analysis methods, interpretation of their results and finally storage of them to be available for further reuse.
A foundational assumption of the following approaches is the positive impact of increasing Yelp's star rating on the revenue of a restaurant, which is a essential finding of \cite{CaseOfYelp}\footnote{Under certain circumstances like no affiliation of the restaurant to a chain.}. Based on this, predictive methods are applied  to investigate which features lead to good restaurant ratings.
