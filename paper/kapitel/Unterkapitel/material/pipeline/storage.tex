\paragraph{Data Storage}
\label{par:storage}
As a storage for the datasets the Google Cloud Platform was used. Before that, it is necessary to configure it first. You have to create a GCP-Project and then put the collected data in the Google Cloud Datastore which is a NoSQL document database. From there, it was possible to create a postgreSQL istance with Cloud SQL, the fully-managed relational database service of Google Cloud. For setting up a connection a proxy or current ip address is required.
