\subsubsection{Data Storage}
\label{subsubsec:storage}
To make the data available for analysis and visualization, it must be read from the \gds{}, mapped to the respective table format and persisted in \pg{} database tables.
\newline
This \textit{Data Storage} process is handled by the \code{transporter}.
If it is required to implement a new transporter the only part that needs to be written is the mapping from a \gds{} entity to a \pg{} table.
\newline
In summary, the following steps describe the development of a new \textit{transporter}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Creation of a new \pg{} table
  \item Creation of a new \code{transporter} subclass
  \item Implementation of the abstract mapping method
\end{enumerate}
