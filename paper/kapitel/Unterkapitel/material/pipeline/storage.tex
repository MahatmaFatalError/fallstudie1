\subsubsection{Data Storage}
\label{subsubsec:storage}
To make the data available for analysis and visualization, it must be read from the \gds{}, mapped to the respective table format and eventually persisted into the \pg{} database tables.
\newline
This \textit{Data Storage} process is handled by the  \code{transporter}. If it is required to implement a new transporter the only part that needs to be written is the mapping from a \gds{} Entity to a \pg{} table.
\newline
In summary, the following steps describe the development of a new \textit{transporter}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Create a new \pg{} table
  \item Create a new \code{<example>\_transporter.py} module that inherits from the base \code{Transporter} class.
  \item Implementation of the mapping method.
\end{enumerate}
