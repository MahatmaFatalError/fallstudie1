\subsection{Data Sources}
\label{subsec:sources}
Many different sources were found and integrated for the analysis of suitable cities for a restaurant. 

\paragraph{Yelp}
The community website Yelp was one of the most important data sources for the evaluations. The Yelp Fusion\footnote{\href{https://www.yelp.com/fusion}{www.yelp.com/fusion}} interface provides valuable information on existing restaurants to indicate their quality or potential competitors. Available restaurant data includes the number of restaurants, the name of the restaurant, the type of food, the number of ratings, the average rating in general, and the coordinates of the restaurant with latitude and longitude. However, the storage time of the Yelp data is limited, so an appropriate infrastructure for data acquisition and analysis must be in place.

\paragraph {Buying Power}
As stated by \cite{locana}, buying power in a restaurant's catchment area is a critical factor in the sense that purchasing power determines the price level of a restaurant. It makes little sense to open a five-star restaurant in a social area. Therefore we also integrated a survey \cite{buyingpower} from the year 2018 with information about purchasing power in German cities and used it for our analyses.
\newline
\paragraph{Immobilienscout24}
In connection with purchasing power, it is absolutely necessary to be aware of the rental costs at certain locations in order to finance the property in the long term\cite{locana}. An interface to a popular real estate platform \cite{ImmoScout} then opened up the possibility of obtaining accurate real-time rental and real estate prices and including them in our analysis.
\newline
\paragraph{Speisekarte}
In order to be able to make a statement about what kind of food is popular and should be offered or what service was often mentioned and should considered, a programmed algorithm was used to collect and aggregate the words in real time from a website \cite{speisekarte} for the evaluation of dishes for specified cities.

\paragraph{GermanCities}
Finally, the Federal Statistical Office provides fine-grained data on urban areas, population and thus population density in the form of a downloadable Excel table.\cite{destatis}
