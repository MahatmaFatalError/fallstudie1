\subsection{Data Sources}
\label{subsec:sources}
Many different sources were found and integrated for the analysis of suitable cities for a restaurant.
\newline
\paragraph{Yelp}
The community website Yelp was one of the most important data sources for the evaluations. The Yelp Fusion\footnote{\href{https://www.yelp.com/fusion}{www.yelp.com/fusion}} interface provides valuable information on existing restaurants to indicate their quality or potential competitors. Available restaurant data includes the number of restaurants, the name of the restaurant, the type of food, the number of ratings, the average rating in general, and the coordinates of the restaurant with latitude and longitude. However, the storage time of the Yelp data is limited, so an appropriate infrastructure for data acquisition and analysis must be in place.
\newline
\paragraph {Buying Power}
As stated by \cite{locana}, buying power in a restaurant's catchment area is a critical factor in the sense that buying power determines the price level of a restaurant. It makes little sense to open a five-star restaurant in a social area. Therefore we also integrated a survey \cite{buyingpower} from the year 2018 with information about purchasing power in German cities and used it for our analyses.
\newline
\paragraph{ImmobilienScout24}
In connection with buying power, it is absolutely necessary to be aware of the rental costs at certain locations in order to finance the property in the long term\cite{locana}. An interface to a popular real estate platform \cite{ImmoScout} then opened up the possibility of obtaining accurate real-time rental and real estate prices and including them in our analysis.
\newline
\paragraph{Speisekarte.de}
In order to be competitive, a recommendation should be made about what foods are popular or what services people are interested in. With the help of a own-developed algorithm we were able to scrape information from a website \cite{speisekarte} for the evaluation of dishes from certain cities. These were aggregated to be used for our analysis.
\newline
\paragraph{German Cities}
The Federal Statistical Office provides fine-grained data on urban areas, population and thus population density in the form of a downloadable \ac{CSV} file.\cite{destatis}
\paragraph{German Zip Codes}
To make sure that the retrieved \ylp{} restaurants are located in the desired city and informations from other sources are more precise, the zip code from each of the german cities are also required. The file from zip codes where collected from a german website.\cite{plz}
