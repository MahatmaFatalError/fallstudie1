\subsection{Data Sources}
\label{subsec:sources}
Many different sources were found and integrated for the analysis of suitable locations for a restaurant. The community website Yelp was one of the most important data sources for the evaluations. The Yelp Fusion\footnote{\href{https://www.yelp.com/fusion}{www.yelp.com/fusion}} interface provides valuable information about existing restaurants to indicate their quality or potential competitors. Available restaurant data include i.a. the number of restaurants, restaurant name, type of food, count of ratings, the mean rating in general as well as the coordinates of the restaurant with latitude and longitude.% However, the storage time of Yelp data is limited, so a suitable infrastructure for data ingestion and analysis is needed.

As stated by \cite{locana}, buying power in the catchment area of a gastronomy business is a crucial factor in the sense that buying power determines the price level of a restaurant. It makes little sense to open a five-star restaurant in a social focus area. That's why a survey conducted in 2018 by \cite{buyingpower} containing information about buying power in German cities is also adapted for integration.

In connection with buying power it is absolutely necessary to be aware of rental costs in specific locations in order to afford the property for long term \cite{locana}. Thereupon an interface to a popular real estate platform \cite{ImmoScout} opens up the possibility to get accurate real time rental and property prices to include them in our analysis.

Finally, the Federal Statistical Office of Germany provides fine grained data about city areas, population and therefore population density in form of a downloadable Excel spread sheet.\cite{destatis}
