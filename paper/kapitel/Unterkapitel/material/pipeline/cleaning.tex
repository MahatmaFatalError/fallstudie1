\paragraph{Data cleaning}
\label{subsec:Data cleaning}
The collected datasets in the Datastore were not messy, but there was still a lot of cleaning activities to do. The yelp data itself had some inconsistencies. Especially the columns price\_range and review\_count had a lot of empty values. The price\_range was filled with the average value of \euro\euro. For the column review\_count ...%vorgehen?

Moreover the data from yelp obviously did not match exactly with the other datasets. The buying power dataset did not include all the cities, that were listed in yelp. To solve this problem the empty values were filled with the average value of Germany. The same problem occured with the rent average dataset which was solved the same way.
