%Ãœberleitung zur Motivation
Investors and restaurant owners are always looking for new possibilities to find a suitable location for a new restaurant or similar project. On the one hand the location plays a role, whether in the big city or in a less populated region, on the other hand financial aspects also play a role, whether one can afford an investment in the respective city at all. Last but not least, an investor must be clear about what he wants to offer, whether haute cuisine or a snack stand? We have become aware of this demand to use data from the World Wide Web to search for a suitable location for a restaurant. With the help of search engines and advanced programming techniques, the World Wide Web offers the opportunity to determine the location, the type and even the price. The comparison portals and enterprise platforms are for different reasons more endeavored to give their contents into the hands of communities \cite{socialbusiness}.  This also creates more possibilities for accessing the data for evaluation and analysis.
