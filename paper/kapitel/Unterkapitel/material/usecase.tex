%Ãœberleitung zur Use Case Beschreibung und die Fragestellung
Investors called SCHULPS are holding different restaurants all over the world and now they want to start a restaurant business somewhere in Germany with a budget of \EUR{650,000}.  As the existing restaurant types of the investors do not have a determined idea due to the different countries and cultures they are open minded for a random concept in Germany. This implies, that criterias like the location, the size or the menu of the restaurant can be chosen freely. The only requirement which is specified is that the monthly sales should be around \EUR{40,000}.
