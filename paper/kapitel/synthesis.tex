\section{Literature Synthesis}
\label{sec:synthesis}
There are many papers present which are referring to the restaurant business but most of them either have a different point of view or are focusing on a very specific part like the siting of a restaurant or the impact of online ratings.

The latter aspect is deeply discussed in the paper from Havard Unversity\cite{CaseOfYelp}. In this the author elaborates on the significant influence of Yelp user ratings on the revenue of restaurants. His investigation is based on data of Washingtonâ€™s State Department of Revenue. Hence, he proves the positive effect of customer ratings on a restaurant's revenue, at least for non-chain affiliated restaurants in the United States. This is definitely a valuable insight which acts as a baseline of the analysis part for this paper since there is no equivalent accounting data of independent restaurants in Germany available. 

Second, the bachelor thesis of Hasan\cite{Imatra} is about market analysis of existing restaurants based on various research methods. His goal is decision support on what kind of restaurant should be opened in a given city in eastern Finland. His approach heavily relies on surveys of the local population. Hence, he focuses on a standardized questionnaires rather than the broad variety of online reviews. Moreover, in contrast to the problem statement of this paper he does not aim to find a optimal location as he restricted his research to a narrow region. 

In the paper \cite{SentimentAnalysis} the authors proposed a method to identify the sentiment tendency of restaurant reviews and to classify them to a specific type of restaurant. Although their analysis is based on the Yelp Dataset Challenge\footnote{\href{https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge}{www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge}} and thus seems to be closely related to this paper, they neither provide insights for non-english reviews nor a holistic investigation that exceeds online reviews which is a major goal of this paper.
