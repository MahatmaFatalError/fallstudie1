\section{Literature Synthesis}
\label{sec:synthesis}
Essentially there are lots of different papers in the world wide web which are running in that restaurant business direction but most of them do have entirely different points of view. The focus of other papers was only on a specific partition of it like siting of a restaurant or the impact of online ratings. 

Last-named aspect belongs to the paper from Havard Unversity\cite{CaseOfYelp}. In this the author writes about the significant influence of yelp user ratings on the revenue of restaurants from data of Washingtonâ€™s State Department of Revenue and proves it with statistical models. This is definitely a good insight but focusses as mentioned on just one specific partition of the restaurant business. Further it was not possible to use restaurants revenues as a key figure for this thesis because there are no profits and losses published for independent restaurants in Germany. Only restaurant chains with a huge number of restaurant branches and a yearly turnover were available. Due to too vague estimate this was renounced for statistical purposes in this paper.

In other bachelor thesis \cite{Imatra} it's all about the market analysis of existing restaurants based on various research methods to discover new possible restaurant businesses. This approach relates to the evaluation of surveys for a part of Imatra's population with single questions and does not focus on online review platforms like yelp and its variety of attributes. In addition to that this paper it was not neccessary to find a suitable location because there aldready is one with Imatra, Finland.
