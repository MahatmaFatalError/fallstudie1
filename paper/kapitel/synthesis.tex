\section{Literature Synthesis}
\label{sec:synthesis}
Essentially there are lots of different papers in the world wide web which are running in that restaurant business direction but those are either from entirely different points of view or are focussing on a specific partition of it like siting of a restaurant or the impact of online ratings. 

Last-named aspect belongs to the paper of Michael Luca, a professor of Havard Unversity, called „reviews, reputation and revenue: the case of yelp.com“. In this Mr. Luca writes about the significant influence of yelp user ratings on the revenue of restaurants from data of Washington’s State Department of Revenue and proves it with statistical models. This statement belongs to independent restaurants only and not to restaurant chains like Mc Donalds he said. This key figure should be also used for this thesis but it was not possible to analyze restaurants revenues because there are no profits and losses published for independent restaurants in Germany. Only restaurant chains with a huge number of restaurant branches and a yearly turnover were available. Due to too vague estimate this was renounced for statistical purposes in this paper.
