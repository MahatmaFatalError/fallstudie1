\paragraph{Conclusion}
The aim of the paper was to recommend in which cities in Germany a new restaurant of a certain kind can be opened, taking into account the financial framework conditions. To achieve this, we first integrated the restaurant data into the Google Cloud Datastore using the Yelp API and self-developed python code to store it in a PostgreSQL database instance. Despite the limited resources, we found additional data sources, integrated them and added them to the existing data. The used data sources are live data such as Immoscout or Yelp as well as data which was published several years ago. After the data had been cleansed and standardized accordingly, the analysis could begin. The original idea was to use revenue as a dependent variable for a regression analysis. To date, however, no turnover data on Germany's restaurant have been publicly available on the Internet. Instead, we have used the rating as an indicator for a successful restaurant business and as a dependent variable. However, this approach turned out to be unsuitable as the rating was not significant. This assumption could also be confirmed by an evaluation visualisation Tableau, as there was an even distribution of restaurants in throughout Germany irrespective of the level of the rating. % Verweis auf Grafik 
Even the second approach with a decision tree did not provide significant results for the analysis. Therefore, we have used other parameters to develop our own KPI to obtain the potential of possible cities. The parameters were on the one hand the restaurant density, which was calculated from the existing restaurants and the population, on the other hand the sum of the user reviews and the average rating. These were smoothed with a SoftMax function to eliminate outliers. With this KPI a top 10 list of potential cities could be identified. Within these top 10, most of the cities were in the federal state of Nordrhein- Westfalen, led by Bochum. After that we examined the potential cities for underrepresented restaurant categories. For this purpose, the number of restaurants per city was compared with all restaurants in Germany. It could be determined that for Bochum, for example, a traditional German restaurant or a café could be considered as a possible restaurant category.
In order to achieve the required turnover from the usecase, a formula for calculating the parameters required total floor space and number of seats was developed using a benchmark. Subsequently, a search was carried out via the Immoscout API for commercial real estate for sale and rent that meet these requirements. The objects were checked for their affordability. %table cities?
Using a self-developed algorithm, individual user reviews were picked up and analysed from the Yelp platform. With this review analysis certain words were determined and aggregated. The frequency of the words was used to determine which features customers considered to be most important. %result?

As the menu can be also an important indicator of success, the menus of restaurants in Bochum were analyzed. It turned out that rumpsteak is the most popular item.
The method in this paper describes a recommended procedure for finding a restaurant in a city in Germany at a pre-defined financial framework with the help of publicly accessible data.

\paragraph{Future Work}
Obviously, there are many different ways to improve the obtained results and to extend this thesis. First of all, the analysis of the restaurant data refers exclusively to the Yelp platform. In order to validate this data, it would be useful to collect further data from other sources such as Google, Facebook or Tripadvisor. The same applies to the determination of real estate and the rent index, which refer solely to Immobilienscout. \newline
Moreover the potential formula could be improved by using further independent variables. In addition to the population data, tourism data of the individual cities in Germany could also be included in order to obtain more representative results for the ratio between people and restaurants. Concerning this matter a data acquisition could also be carried out for this thesis. This could be done through surveys of residents and tourists in order to receive further and more precise results in relation to the potential formula. For the latter, only positive, independent variables were considered in this paper. But also the influence of negative factors such as data from crime statistics could be relevant. \newline
When selecting the individual restaurant categories, the influence of ethnic groups could also be significant, as there are certain neighbourhoods, especially in larger cities, where people with a migration background live. Data from the platform of Google Trends could also be used for a specific restaurant category or food to identify current trends at an early stage and to use them as restaurant owner for the menu. \newline
The review analysis could be enhanced by analyzing the uploaded images on Yelp based on certain criteria in order to prove and extend the significance of the existing user reviews. With current data of the wages and salaries of Germany‘s population, another quantitative variable could be added to the financial analysis for an improvement.
