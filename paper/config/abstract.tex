Many people have the ambition to be self-employed and want to start a restaurant business. But to run a restaurant can be risky due to lots of different requirements. A well-conceived idea for a restaurant is necessary to be successful and competitive. 
The purpose of this thesis is to make a recommendation for a new restaurant business in Germany based on various data sources, especially from the community platform of yelp, because it's database includes lots of different facts such as the restaurant name, the rating, the user's review and the location.
But for a significant analysis more information is necessary. Therefor we collected other data like the population, the buying power and the rent average for commercial real estate for all cities of Germany. With a combination of these key figures we created an own KPI to find out the most appropriate cities in Germany to open a restaurant. Moreover we did a review analysis with the user's reviews on Yelp to get more insights about the customers preferations. Further to this the menu's of existing restaurants for one city were analyzed. For the financial aspects we used a benchmark of Germany's catering industry to develop a formula to reach a specific turnover. With this formula it was possible to check the affordability of existing commercial real estate for rent and sale. The results of this thesis show a top 10 list of cities in Germany where a restaurant business can be started and how the required turnover can be achieved.
