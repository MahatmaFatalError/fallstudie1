Many people have the ambition to be self-employed and want to start a restaurant business. But to run a restaurant can be risky due to lots of different requirements. A well-conceived idea for a restaurant is necessary to be successful and competitive. 
The purpose of this thesis is to make a recommendation for a new restaurant business in Germany based on various data sources, especially from the community platform of yelp, because it's database includes lots of different facts such as the restaurant name, the rating, the user's review and the location.
But for a significant analysis more information is necessary. Therefor we collected other data like the population, the buying power and the rent average for industrial buildings for all cities of Germany. With a combination of these key figures we created a own kpi to find out the most suitable cities in Germany to open a restaurant. Moreover we did a sentiment analysis with the user's reviews on yelp to get more insights about the favorite dishes. Further to this the menu's of existing restaurants for an example city were analysed. 
For the financial aspects we used a benchmark of Germany's catering industry to get reference values for the investors restaurant.
