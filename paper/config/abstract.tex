Many people have the ambition to be self-employed and want to start a restaurant business. But to run a restaurant can be risky due to lots of different requirements. A well-conceived idea for a restaurant is necessary to be successful and competitive. 
The purpose of this thesis is to make a recommendation for a new restaurant business in Germany based on various data sources, especially from the community platform of yelp, because it's database includes lots of different facts such as the restaurant name, the rating, the user's review and the location.
But for a significant analysis more information is necessary. Therefor we collect other data like the population, buying power and rent average for industrial buildings of all cities in Germany. With a combination of these key figures we introduce a KPI to find the most suitable cities in Germany to open a restaurant. Moreover, we conduct a sentiment analysis Yelp user reviews to get more insights about the existing restaurants and it's favorite dishes. Further to this the menu of existing restaurants for an example city is analyzed. Regarding financial aspects we use a benchmark of Germany's catering industry to get reference values for businesses in the catering industry. The results show a top 10 list of cities in Germany with good conditions to open a restaurant business and how the required turnover can be achieved.
